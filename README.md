# mkpw â€“ a password generation utility

This is a simple C++ implementation of a password generation utility.
The main reason for this application to be written is a C++ TDD approach and package management testing (we're using CMake-based [Hunter](https://github.com/ruslo/hunter) here, if you're interested).
I'll be happy if you find this utility useful.
